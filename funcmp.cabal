Description:
  Functional MetaPost is a Haskell frontend to the MetaPost language by John
  Hobby. Users write their graphics as Haskell programs, which then emit
  MetaPost code that can be compiled into encapsulated PostScript files and
  smoothly included into e.g. LaTeX.
  .
  A collection of useful examples how to use Functional MetaPost can be found
  in the <http://download.savannah.nongnu.org/releases/funcmp/Manual_eng.ps user's manual>.
  The document doesn't offer very much detail in terms of explanations, but the
  code samples are quite helpful. Further documentation can be found in the
  <http://download.savannah.nongnu.org/releases/funcmp/Thesis_eng.ps original thesis>
  that describes the implementation. The text is also available in
  <http://download.savannah.nongnu.org/releases/funcmp/Thesis.ps German>.
  .
  Last but not least, there is a
  <http://download.savannah.nongnu.org/releases/funcmp/Tutorial_eng.ps tutorial>
  that offers many helpful examples (which is also available in
  <http://download.savannah.nongnu.org/releases/funcmp/Tutorial.ps German>).
